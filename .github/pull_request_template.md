## PR Steps

These steps are to ensure you correctly make a PR. _Please delete them before submitting the PR!_

1. Test and lint your code locally with `make pr` before opening a PR to save yourself time!
2. For almost all development, you should be targeting `dev` rather than `main`. Only releases target `main`!
3. Give your PR a descriptive name, and prefix that name with one of the following options:
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `repo:` for repository fixes
   - `deps:` for dependency updates
   - If your PR does more than one of the above, focus on the primary purpose of your PR. E.g. if you have fixed small bugs in the process of implementing a feature, use `feat:`
4. Tag your PR! It makes it easier to know what's going on at a glance
5. Assign yourself to make clear you're working on it
