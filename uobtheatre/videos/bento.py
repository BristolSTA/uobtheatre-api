"""
Bento is a powerful tool which we use to covert mp4s into encrypted mp4dash
files. Currently we use the binaries from the bento sdk directly. This is a
pretty horrible solution and hopefully we can swap these out for the c++/python
libraries in the future. For now though we will have to make sure we install
the binaries before working on the bento side of things.

TODO:
Find a way to store the bento stuff (probably the drive) with install
instructions. For now the aim is to make bento stuff a seperate thing that most
people wont care about. If someone want to work on the bento stuff it will
require a couple of extra steps but then they should be good to go as well.

NOTES:
mp4fragment - can probably use Mp4Fragment.cpp directly, gonna need to do some
reading

mp4dash - https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/issues/274
mp4dash is written in python and depends on the c++ binaries (I think)
